Tasks:

Step 1: User Interface Design

Create a visually appealing dashboard layout with components like task lists, task cards, filters, and a sidebar for navigation, very similar to task management website used by enterprises like 
Trello
, 
ClickUp
, etc. Design an intuitive interface that enhances usability and productivity. 

Step 2: Component State Management

Utilize React state and props to manage the state of individual components. Use state to store and update task data, including titles, descriptions, due dates, and completion status.

Step 3: React Hooks for Side Effects and Stateful Logic

Implement React Hooks like useEffect and useState to handle side effects such as API requests and manage stateful logic like sorting tasks or applying filters.

Step 4: Redux for Advanced State Management (if applicable)

Integrate Redux for advanced state management if your application requires it. Redux helps manage global application state, handle asynchronous actions, and provides a centralized store for components to access.

Step 5: DOM Manipulation Techniques

Enhance user interactions by implementing DOM manipulation techniques such as event listeners. For example, enable drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks or utilize tooltips for additional task information.

Step 6: Responsive Design

Ensure your application is responsive by using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Flexbox. Create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
