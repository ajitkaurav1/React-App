The following features have been included in this project.

1. Created a navigation bar to navigate other pages. 
2. I utilized React Router Dom for navigation.
3. I have used props to pass data from the parent component to the child component. 
4. I use state and effect hooks.
5. Added a drag and drop feature to manipulate the DOM.
6. used the JSON Fake API to display the album and create a new one.

In this component, handle the form with proper validation. Once the user enters the proper input, then they can submit the form.

In this component, I have used usestate and useeffect hooks to obtain data from the fake API.
